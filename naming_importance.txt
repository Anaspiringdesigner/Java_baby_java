Some good to follow rules are

Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart

Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, c etc..

Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data, value etc.. Such 
names say nothing and they may cause issues in the long run.

Agree on terms with your team or on your mind. if a site visitor is called user then we should
name variables as currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor  or newManInTown!!!
